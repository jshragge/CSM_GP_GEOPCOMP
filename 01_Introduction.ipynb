    "# Introduction to Geophysical Computing\n",
    "\n",
    "For the modern professional geophysicists, the use of computers and algorithms is ubiquitous in all aspects of the daily routine.  Whether using a \"canned\" commercial geophysical software application to or developing new code to address a particular task, employing/implementing some sort of computational algorithm is almost always at the heart of any geophysical task.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The challenge of canned software\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the key challenges geophysicsts face when using commercial geophysical software is that it is often difficult to determine what is going on \"under the hood\".  In many instances it may seem that geophysical results are found in the following way:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \n",
    "\\boxed{\\begin{array}{c}\\mathrm{Field}\\\\\\mathrm{Geophysical}\\\\\\mathrm{Data}\\end{array}}\n",
    "\\Longrightarrow \n",
    "\\boxed{\\begin{array}{c}\\mathrm{Magic\\,Black}\\\\\\mathrm{Box\\,of\\, Geophysical}\\\\\\mathrm{Data\\,Processing}\\end{array}}\n",
    "\\Longrightarrow \n",
    "\\boxed{\\begin{array}{c}\\mathrm{Top-notch}\\\\\\mathrm{Geophysical}\\\\\\mathrm{Result}\\end{array}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Often there are numerous parameters that go into the blackbox, various combinations of which can greatly affect the output results! It can be extremely frustrating for users - especially when the documentation and usage examples cannot be found, and there is no open-source code to help figure it out.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Python and Scientific Libraries\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the major goals of this course is to strip away some of the **magic black box** nature of how students approach geophysical computing, and to provide a better conceptual idea of what is going on when software is applied to tackle geophysical problems.  That said, it is not our goal to \"reinvent the wheel\" on absolutely every algorithm because this would take far too long and one would never finish finding solutions to the problem at hand.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The approach we are taking in this course tries to find a middle way.  In particular, we will focus on the **Python** language and leverage its open-source, diverse and well validated computational toolkits including **Numpy** and **Scipy** as well as the strong plotting library **Matplotlib**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "However, to fully appreciate the theory behind some of these tools, it is important to code up some algorithms by oneself to help deepen the understanding of just what the algorithm is doing. Moreover, there will be scenarios where one has to develop a full computer program for a specialized task for which no community-based solution exists.  In these cases, Python may not be the optimal language in which to develop and thus there will be the need to include algorithms directly embedded into the code. Having a deeper understanding of the geophysical algoritms will be greatly helpful in these scenarios. Overall, it is our hope that this will assist students in designing better geophysical computing solutions that will facilitate achiement of the geophysical data processing goals."

    "## Course Aims\n",
    "\n",
    "The course is intended to provide senior-level undergraduate and first-year graduate students with material that aimed at improving the algorithmic, programming and computing skills, while simultaneously enhancing skills in handling geophysical data sets.  In some ways, these skills are those that are not really taught in any one particular geophysics course; however, they are often the \"glue\" that students need to help stick together disparate components learned in specific courses into a workable solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we were to broadly classify the material presented in this course, it could be broken down into the following three skill sets:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Handling Geophysical Data: \n",
    "    * **Data Interpolation**\n",
    "    * **Regression (Model Fitting)**\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "* Applied Numerical Algorithms\n",
    "    * **Numerical Quadrature (Integration)**\n",
    "    * **Applied Linear Algebra for Geophysical Problems**\n",
    "    * **Solutions to Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs)** \n",
    "    * **Differentiation and Discretization**\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "* Numerical Solutions of Geophysical Partial Differential Equations (PDEs): \n",
    "    * **Elliptical PDEs (Laplace and Poisson Equations)**\n",
    "    * **Parabolic PDEs (2D Heat Flow)**\n",
    "    * **Hyperbolic PDEs (2D Acoustic wave equation)**\n",
