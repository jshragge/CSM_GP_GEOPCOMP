    "\n",

    "For the modern professional geophysicists, the use of computers and algorithms is ubiquitous in all aspects of the daily routine.  Whether using a \"canned\" commercial geophysical software application to or developing new code to address a particular task, employing/implementing some sort of computational algorithm is almost always at the heart of any geophysical task.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The challenge of canned software\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the key challenges geophysicsts face when using commercial geophysical software is that it is often difficult to determine what is going on \"under the hood\".  In many instances it may seem that geophysical results are found in the following way:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \n",
    "\\boxed{\\begin{array}{c}\\mathrm{Field}\\\\\\mathrm{Geophysical}\\\\\\mathrm{Data}\\end{array}}\n",
    "\\Longrightarrow \n",
    "\\boxed{\\begin{array}{c}\\mathrm{Magic\\,Black}\\\\\\mathrm{Box\\,of\\, Geophysical}\\\\\\mathrm{Data\\,Processing}\\end{array}}\n",
    "\\Longrightarrow \n",
    "\\boxed{\\begin{array}{c}\\mathrm{Top-notch}\\\\\\mathrm{Geophysical}\\\\\\mathrm{Result}\\end{array}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Often there are numerous parameters that go into the blackbox, various combinations of which can greatly affect the output results! It can be extremely frustrating for users - especially when the documentation and usage examples cannot be found, and there is no open-source code to help figure it out.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Python and Scientific Libraries\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the major goals of this course is to strip away some of the **magic black box** nature of how students approach geophysical computing, and to provide a better conceptual idea of what is going on when software is applied to tackle geophysical problems.  That said, it is not our goal to \"reinvent the wheel\" on absolutely every algorithm because this would take far too long and one would never finish finding solutions to the problem at hand.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The approach we are taking in this course tries to find a middle way.  In particular, we will focus on the **Python** language and leverage its open-source, diverse and well validated computational toolkits including **Numpy** and **Scipy** as well as the strong plotting library **Matplotlib**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "However, to fully appreciate the theory behind some of these tools, it is important to code up some algorithms by oneself to help deepen the understanding of just what the algorithm is doing. Moreover, there will be scenarios where one has to develop a full computer program for a specialized task for which no community-based solution exists.  In these cases, Python may not be the optimal language in which to develop and thus there will be the need to include algorithms directly embedded into the code. Having a deeper understanding of the geophysical algoritms will be greatly helpful in these scenarios. Overall, it is our hope that this will assist students in designing better geophysical computing solutions that will facilitate achiement of the geophysical data processing goals."

To do this, we we will explore some of the fundamentals of **interpolation** and see a number of different ways in which plausible maps can be created in 1D and 2D.  Many of these algorithms even can be exported to higher dimensions for those cases where 3D, 4D and even 5D interpolation is required; however, these fall beyond the scope of this module.\n"

Arguably, it would easier to integrate the red curve if it were given by some analytic function.  However, how accurate would this actually be given that the model doesn't exact match data!\n",

Another question would be if the comet contains 1% per volume of iron ore, how much iron ore is there available in the comet?  Evidently, these questions would require evaluating 2D and 3D integrals over some irregular surface that is not easily described by analytic functions $g(x,y)$ and $h(x,y,z)$!  \n",

You may have played around with higher order polynomials up to and including the same order of fit as the number of data points!\n",

    "While it may be numerically possible to perfectly fit an underlying model (except perhaps when interpolating!), this is seldom the optimal thing to do.

Of course we may be interested in fitting models to much higher order data in order to be able to generate some more complex model that we could possibly hope to visualize in 1D or 2D images. This type of analysis is proving to be fundamental in **data science** and **machine learning** applications in the geosciences."
