    "## Course Description from Bulletin ##\n",
    "\n",
    "This course develops the principles of geophysical computing in the context of simulating and validating numerical solutions to the types of partial differential equations commonly found in geophysical investigations (e.g., potential fields, heat flow/diffusion, seismic wave propagation). Students are introduced to architecture of modern computing systems and learn how algorithms can be developed to leverage this architecture to efficiently generate numerical solutions to multidimensional geophysical problems using parallel computing methods. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Outcomes\n",
    "\n",
    "This senior-level undergraduate course builds on analytical geophysical and numerical/computational skills learned in previous years by applying them in the context of common geophysical computing challenges. Major objectives of the course include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Students will understand and be able to apply concepts of computing in the context of solving complex geophysical problem, many involving field data.\n",
    "2. Students will develop practical programming skills and combine with knowledge of numerical algorithms to solve real-world geophysical problems.\n",
    "3. Students will develop independent research skills by undertaking a project involving a substantial piece of analytic, numerical and computation work involving solving a real-world geophysical problem\n",
    "4. Independently design, develop, validate and apply computer programs to solve geophysical data analysis and numerical modeling tasks, largely using the Python language and its associated tool kits (i.e., Numpy, Scipy and Matplotlib).  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Course Assessment procedures ##\n",

    "All students are advised to be familiar with CSM’s policy regarding the make-up of work missed due to excused absences. This policy may be found in the Bulletin.  If a student is ill and exhibits flu-like symptoms, they should not attend class, labs, or exams. In order for an absence based on illness to be excused, the student must normally communicate directly with the Associate Dean of Students or his/her instructors. In all cases of unexcused absences the faculty member has the right to deny the student the opportunity to make up all or part of the missed work. **Coursework must be turned in before it is due to be graded – plan ahead.**\n",

    "## Diversity and Inclusion ##\n",
    "\n",
    "At Colorado School of Mines, we understand that a diverse and inclusive learning environment inspires creativity and innovation, which are essential to the engineering process. We also know that in order to address current and emerging national and global challenges, it is important to learn with and from people who have different backgrounds, thoughts, and experiences.\n",
    "Our students represent every state in the nation and more than 90 countries around the world, and we continue to make progress in the areas of diversity and inclusion by providing [Diversity and Inclusion programs and services](https://www.mines.edu/about/diversity-and-inclusion/) to support these efforts.\n",

Mines’ core values of respect, diversity, compassion, and collaboration will be honored in this course, and the standards in this class are the same as those expected in any professional work environment. (More information can be found [here](http://inside.mines.edu/UserFiles/File/FacultySenate/Documents/ValuesAndAspirationsStatement2-14-17.pdf).) **Discrimination or harassment of any type will not be tolerated.** As a participant in this course, we expect you to respect your instructor and your classmates. As your instructor, it is my responsibility to foster a learning environment that supports diversity of thoughts, perspectives and experiences, and honors your identities.  \n",
    "\n",
    "To help accomplish this:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Course rosters are provided to the instructor with the student’s legal name. I will honor your request to address you by an alternate name or gender pronoun. Please advise me of this preference early in the semester so that I may make appropriate changes to my records. \n",

    "\n",
    "In this course, we will cultivate a community that supports survivors, prevents interpersonal violence, and promotes a harassment free environment. Title IX and Colorado State law protects individuals from discrimination based on sex and gender in educational programs and activities. Mines takes this obligation seriously and is committed to providing a campus community free from gender and sex-based discrimination. Discrimination, including sexual harassment, sexual violence, stalking, and domestic violence, is prohibited and will not be tolerated within the Mines campus community. If these issues have affected you or someone you know, you can access the appropriate resources on the [Mines Title IX website](https://www.mines.edu/title-ix/). You can also contact the Mines Title IX Coordinator, Camille Torres, at 303.384.2124 or [titleix@mines.edu](titleix@mines.edu) for more information.\n",

    "## Policy on academic integrity and misconduct ##  \n",
    "\n",
    "The Colorado School of Mines affirms the principle that all individuals associated with the Mines academic community have a responsibility for establishing, maintaining an fostering an understanding and appreciation for academic integrity. In broad terms, this implies protecting the environment of mutual trust within which scholarly exchange occurs, supporting the ability of the faculty to fairly and effectively evaluate every student’s academic achievements, and giving credence to the university’s educational mission, its scholarly objectives and the substance of the degrees it awards. The protection of academic integrity requires there to be clear and consistent standards, as well as confrontation and sanctions when individuals violate those standards. The Colorado School of Mines desires an environment free of any and all forms of academic misconduct and expects students to act with integrity at all times.\n",
    "\n",
    "Academic misconduct is the intentional act of fraud, in which an individual seeks to claim credit for the work and efforts of another without authorization, or uses unauthorized materials or fabricated information in any academic exercise. Student Academic Misconduct arises when a student violates the principle of academic integrity. Such behavior erodes mutual trust, distorts the fair evaluation of academic achievements, violates the ethical code of behavior upon which education and scholarship rest, and undermines the credibility of the university. Because of the serious institutional and individual ramifications, student misconduct arising from violations of academic integrity is not tolerated at Mines. If a student is found to have engaged in such misconduct sanctions such as change of a grade, loss of institutional privileges, or academic suspension or dismissal may be imposed.\n",
