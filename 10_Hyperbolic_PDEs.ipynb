    "\n",
    "   * **Acoustic wave equation (Homogeneous medium)**: The acoustic wave equation (AWE) is normally used to model the pressure disturbance $\\phi=\\phi(x,y,z,t)$ generated by an acoustic wave propagation through a fluid medium defined by constant velocity $v=\\sqrt{\\frac{K}{\\rho}}$ where $K$ is the bulk compressibility and $\\rho$ is the density.\n",

Because this is a second-order temporal partial derivative, to uniquely define the wavefield solution one needs to define two **initial conditions** $\\phi(x,y,z,t=0)=f(x,y,z)$ and $\\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial t}(x,y,z,t=0)=\\phi_t=g(x,y,z)$. (Note that the subscript indicates which partial derivative has been applied.) One also has to prescribe the behavior of the solution on the domain boundary $D$ (e.g., $\\left. \\phi\\right|_{\\partial D}=B(x,y,z)$). Note that the acoustic wave equation is commonly used in exploration seismology to approximate compressional (i.e., P-wave) propagation through complex heterogeneous media.\n",
