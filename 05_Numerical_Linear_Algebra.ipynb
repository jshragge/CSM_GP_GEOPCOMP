    "This chapter discuss how to solve linear systems of equations numerically. We start with Gauss elimination, which are similar to how human being solving linear equations on the paper. We will also discuss several variants of this method (Doolittle, Cholesky, Gauss-Jordan). Then we will introduce numeric iteration methods to address the problem. These methods are less intuitive, but more computational effective and much more frequently used nowadays. "
